<h3>1. Who can donate blood?</h3>
<p>Generally, individuals who are in good health, weigh at least 110 pounds, and are above a certain age (usually 17 or 18 years old) may be eligible to donate blood. Specific eligibility criteria may vary by country or blood donation center. Certain medical conditions or recent travel to certain regions may affect eligibility. It's always best to check with your local blood donation center for the most accurate information.</p>

<h3>2. How often can I donate blood?</h3>
<p>The frequency of blood donation depends on various factors, including your health, the type of donation (whole blood, platelets, plasma, etc.), and the guidelines of the blood donation center. In general, whole blood donors can typically donate every 8 to 12 weeks. Platelet and plasma donors may be able to donate more frequently. Again, it's important to consult with your local donation center for specific guidelines.</p>
<p>Blood donations are often separated into components such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma, which can be used individually to treat different medical conditions. Your donation could potentially save the lives of multiple patients in need.</p>
